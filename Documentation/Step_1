📚 Step 1 Documentation: Library Management System Foundation
🎯 Overview
In Step 1, we're setting up the foundational architecture of our Library Management System using core Object-Oriented Programming principles from your syllabus.

🔍 Detailed Code Explanation
1. LibraryItem.h - Header File Analysis
cpp
#ifndef LIBRARYITEM_H
#define LIBRARYITEM_H
Purpose: Header guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file.

Concept: Preprocessor Directives (Unit 2)

#ifndef (if not defined) checks if LIBRARYITEM_H is not defined

If not defined, it defines it and includes the code

Prevents compilation errors from duplicate declarations

cpp
protected:
    std::string title;
    std::string author;
    int publicationYear;
    bool available;
    static int totalItems;  // Static member
Concept: Access Specifiers & Static Members (Unit 3)

protected: Accessible within the class and by derived classes

static int totalItems: Class-level variable shared by all instances

Why static? To track total library items across all objects

cpp
virtual void displayInfo() const = 0;
Concept: Pure Virtual Functions & Abstract Classes (Unit 6)

virtual: Enables runtime polymorphism

= 0: Makes it pure virtual = class becomes abstract

Why abstract? Cannot create LibraryItem objects directly, only through derived classes

cpp
virtual ~LibraryItem();
Concept: Virtual Destructor (Unit 6)

Ensures proper cleanup when deleting objects through base class pointers

Without virtual destructor, derived class destructors might not be called

2. LibraryItem.cpp - Implementation Analysis
cpp
int LibraryItem::totalItems = 0;
Concept: Static Member Initialization (Unit 3)

Static members must be defined outside the class

Initialized to 0 when program starts

cpp
LibraryItem::LibraryItem() 
    : title("Unknown"), author("Unknown"), publicationYear(0), available(true) {
    totalItems++;
}
Concept: Constructor & Member Initialization List (Unit 3)

Constructor: Special member function that initializes objects

Member Initialization List: More efficient than assignment in constructor body

totalItems++: Increments class-level counter for every object created

cpp
LibraryItem::~LibraryItem() {
    totalItems--;
}
Concept: Destructor (Unit 3)

Called automatically when object is destroyed

totalItems--: Decrements counter to maintain accurate count

🎓 Key OOP Concepts Applied
1. Encapsulation (Unit 1)
cpp
private/protected data + public methods = Encapsulation
Data hiding: Member variables are protected

Controlled access through public getters/setters

2. Abstraction (Unit 1, Unit 6)
cpp
virtual void displayInfo() const = 0;  // Hide implementation details
Abstract class defines what to do, not how to do it

Derived classes will provide specific implementations

3. Static Members (Unit 3)
cpp
static int totalItems;  // One copy shared by all objects
Class-level variable, not instance-level

Tracks global information about the class

🧪 Testing Step 1
Create a simple test file to verify our foundation:

cpp
// src/main.cpp (Test File)
#include <iostream>
#include "../include/LibraryItem.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "=== Testing Library Management System Step 1 ===" << endl;
    
    // Test static member
    cout << "Initial total items: " << LibraryItem::getTotalItems() << endl;
    
    // Note: We cannot create LibraryItem objects directly because it's abstract
    // This is intentional - we'll test with derived classes in Step 2
    
    cout << "Step 1 completed successfully!" << endl;
    cout << "Static member working correctly." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
🔧 Compilation Instructions
bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd LibraryManagementSystem

# Compile the files
g++ -c src/LibraryItem.cpp -o src/LibraryItem.o
g++ -c src/main.cpp -o src/main.o
g++ src/LibraryItem.o src/main.o -o library_system

# Run the program
./library_system
❓ Review Questions & Answers
Q1: Why make displayInfo() a pure virtual function?
A: To enforce that all derived classes must provide their own implementation, ensuring polymorphic behavior and making LibraryItem an abstract base class.

Q2: What's the purpose of the static member totalItems?
A: It maintains a class-level counter that tracks how many library item objects exist in the entire system, shared across all instances.

Q3: Why declare the destructor as virtual?
A: When we delete objects through base class pointers, the virtual destructor ensures that both base and derived class destructors are called, preventing memory leaks.
